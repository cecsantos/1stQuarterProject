      <p>This Month's the Barkchelor: Oreo</p><br>
      <p>Oreo was dev's very first pet. He is an energetic and hyper dog, but he also has a tendency to be calm and quiet. He is an incredibly lazy dog, sleeping 20 hours a day, but he also enjoys walking and playing in the nearby park. He has a knack for pulling pranks on dev's dad, especially by setting up traps (poo or pee) outside their doors.<br>
      Oreo is a pandemic doggie. He is very close with dev's family and hates being left alone. He was taught many tricks, the most notable being "walk" (he walks upright), "boop" (he sticks his nose between your fingers), and "bang!" (he plays dead).</p>
