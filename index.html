      <h3>This Month's the Barkchelor: Oreo</h3><br>
      <p>Oreo was dev's very first pet. He is an energetic and hyper dog, but he also has a tendency to be calm and quiet. He is an incredibly lazy dog, sleeping 20 hours a day, but he also enjoys walking and playing in the nearby park. He has a knack for pulling pranks on dev's dad, especially by setting up traps (poo or pee) outside their doors.</p>
