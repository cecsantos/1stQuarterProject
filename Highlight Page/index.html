      <h3>Name: Oreo</h3><br>
      <p>Story: Oreo was Chloe's very first pet. He is an energetic and hyper dog, but he also has a tendency to be calm and quiet. He is an incredibly lazy dog, sleeping almost 20 hours per day, but he also enjoys walking and playing in the nearby park. He has a knack for pulling pranks on Chloe's dad, especially by setting up traps (poo or pee) near his doors.<br><br>
      Oreo is a "pandemic doggie". He is very close with Chloe's family and hates being left alone. He was taught many tricks, the most notable being "walk" (he walks upright), "boop" (he sticks his nose between your fingers), and "bang!" (he plays dead).</p>
