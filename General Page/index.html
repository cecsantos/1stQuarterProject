        <p>Name: Luca<br><br>
        Luca is Chloe's second pet. He was named after Luca Brasi, feared hitman and Don Vito Corleone's personal bodyguard in "The Godfather." However, Luca grew to be quite the opposite of his namesake. He was cute, goofy, and very playful, but he remained protective and fiercely loyal to his owners, just like Brasi.</p>

        <p>Name: Curry<br><br>
        Curry is Oreo and Luca's older cousin, a 6-year-old owned by Chloe's cousins. A graduate of puppy school, Curry is a very well-trained dog. He enjoys dressing up and greeting guests during special occasions, and he will not hesitate to give a kiss or two. </p>
